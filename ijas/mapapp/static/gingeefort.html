    Gingee Fort (also called Senji) is a famous old fort in Tamil Nadu, India.
    It is built on rocky hills and was very important for defence long ago.
    The fort has strong walls, temples, and water tanks â€” it is an important
    place in Indian history.<br><br>

    The fort is spread across three hills and is connected by strong walls and
    hidden paths. Because of its strong construction, it was once called the
    "Troy of the East" by the British.<br><br>

    Many rulers such as the Cholas, Vijayanagara kings, Marathas, Mughals,
    and even the British controlled this fort at different times in history.
    Each of them added new structures and made changes inside the fort.<br><br>

    Today, Gingee Fort is protected as a historical monument and attracts
    many visitors, students, and tourists who are interested in history,
    architecture, and nature.
