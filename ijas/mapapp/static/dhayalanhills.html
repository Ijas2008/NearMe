      Gingee Dhayalan Hills is known as one of the highest points in the Gingee region,
      Tamil Nadu. From the top of the hill, visitors can enjoy a wide view of the
      surrounding landscape, rocky formations, and the historic forts nearby.
      The hills are popular for their natural beauty and peaceful environment.
      The "Dhayalan Hills" refers to the prominent Rajagiri, Krishnagiri, and Chandrayandurg hills that form the foundation of the Gingee Fort, a historically significant fortress in Tamil Nadu, India, once called the "Troy of the East". These three interconnected hillocks feature separate citadels and fortifications, enclosing the vast lower fort area. The fort was built on these formidable natural elevations, providing a strategic defensive advantage, and has served as a nucleus of power for various dynasties, including the Cholas, Vijayanagar kings, Marathas, and the British.  <br></br>
Key Aspects of the Hills and Fort:<br></br>
Strategic Location: The hills provided a natural, elevated foundation for the fort, making it difficult to conquer. <br></br>
Three Hills: The main hills are Rajagiri, Krishnagiri, and Chandrayandurg, which form a triangular pattern. <br></br>
Fortifications: A large rampart and moat surround the complex, while individual walls connect the hills, creating a self-contained defensive system. <br></br>
Historical Significance: The fort complex represents a rich history, with each hill containing its own citadel and various structures like temples, mosques, granaries, and halls. <br></br>
Kalyana Mahal: A notable structure, the seven-storeyed marriage hall (Kalyana Mahal) is located within the fort complex. <br></br>
